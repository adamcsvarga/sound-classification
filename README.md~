# Sound Classification Tool
## Created by Adam Varga, 2015

This tool can be used for na√Øve sound classification. It extracts MFCC coefficients from the sound files, and applies different state-of-the art supervised classification 
methods on them. The number of MFCC-coefficients should be adjusted according to the characteristics of the data at hand by the `num_coeffs` parameter of the functions in `extract_features.py`.
